# AppLea mobile app for communities

This is the official Repository for the developments made on the AppLea mobile app for the netCommons research project. 
AppLea is the evolution of what was earlier the CommonTasker app, an app that intended to ease crowdsourcing of tasks among community members in a CN. The shift of focus towards logging farming activities and data sharing occured after feedback from the local community in the Sarantaporo.gr CN, in the context of a highly participatory design process.

This repository hosts exclusively the code of the AppLea app. The link to the CommonTasker repository is https://github.com/netCommonsEU/CommonTasker

The application uses cellular network, WiFi and GPS technologies to get the location of meteorological stations in the vicinity of the user and show the weather where he or she actually stands. The location updates could be carried out periodically (e.g. hourly); alternatively, the app can use the accelerometer to detect movement.
